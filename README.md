# Runnables in LangChain

This repository provides illustrative examples of using LangChain Runnables, a powerful abstraction for building modular and composable AI workflows. Each script demonstrates a specific Runnable component, showcasing how to construct flexible and maintainable pipelines for language model applications.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### 1-Runnable_Sequence.py
Demonstrates RunnableSequence, enabling the chaining of multiple Runnables to form a sequential pipeline.

### 2-RunnableParallel.py
Showcases RunnableParallel, allowing concurrent execution of multiple Runnables for parallel processing.

### 3-RunnablePassthrough.py
Illustrates RunnablePassthrough, which passes inputs directly to outputs without modification‚Äîuseful for debugging or pipeline placeholders.

### 4-RunnableLambda.py
Utilizes RunnableLambda to wrap simple functions as Runnables, facilitating quick integration of custom logic.

### 5-RunnableBranch.py
Explores RunnableBranch, enabling conditional branching within pipelines based on input criteria.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install langchain
```

### Running Examples
Execute any of the example scripts directly:

```bash
python 1-Runnable_Sequence.py
```

Replace the filename with the desired script to explore different Runnable components.
